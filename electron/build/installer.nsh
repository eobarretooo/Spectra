;
; electron-builder inserts this file's macros into the installer it generates
; — see electron-builder.yml's `nsis.include`. The only one defined here is
; customUnInstall, which runs while the uninstaller is tearing the app down.
;
; This exists because Windows is the one platform that lets an installer run
; anything on the way out. A .dmg is uninstalled by dragging the app to the
; trash, an AppImage by deleting a file, and Android never delivers a removal
; broadcast to the app being removed — none of those give anyone a chance to
; say goodbye, which is why the number this feeds is desktop-only and always
; will be.

; The endpoint the report goes to. A literal rather than something read from
; the environment: NSIS resolves this at compile time, and a build whose
; installer quietly pointed at nothing would look identical to one that
; worked. A dev build simply reports to production and is rejected there —
; its install id was never seen by that server (see recordAppUninstall).

  ; An update is an uninstall too. electron-updater applies a new version by
  ; running this very uninstaller and then installing over the top, so
  ; reporting unconditionally would turn every auto-update into a fake
  ; uninstall — the loudest possible way to be wrong about a number nobody
  ; can sanity-check by eye.
  ;
  ; IfSilent is what separates the two, and it is a core NSIS instruction
  ; rather than something the electron-builder scripts hand us: the updater
  ; runs the uninstaller with /S, while a person removing the app from
  ; Settings or the Control Panel gets the visible one. The cost is that a
  ; genuine `Uninstall.exe /S` from a management tool goes unreported, which
  ; is the safe direction to be wrong in — this number is a floor either way
  ; (a deleted folder or an offline machine leaves no trace at all), and a
  ; missing report is a smaller lie than an invented one.
  ;
  ; Even so, the server treats a report as provisional rather than final: an
  ; install that registers again clears it (see recordAppInstall). So if this
  ; check is ever wrong on some Windows build, the app coming back the way it
  ; does after an update repairs the count on its own.
