// GoLive desktop shell.
//
// This is a *shell around the deployed site*, not a second copy of it. The
// window loads https://golive.nemtudo.me (or whatever GOLIVE_APP_URL says)
// and the entire UI, all the WebRTC, the whole mesh/cascade implementation
// come from there unchanged. That is a deliberate choice and worth stating,
// because the obvious alternative — bundling the Next build inside the app —
// would buy nothing here: this is a real-time communication app, so it is
// useless without a network connection anyway, and the site has server-side
// API routes (/api/giphy, /api/umami) that a static export cannot serve. One
// deploy, one thing to keep working.
//
// What the shell genuinely adds, and what all the code below is for:
//
//   1. A screen picker. Electron does not implement getDisplayMedia's own
//      chooser, so without setDisplayMediaRequestHandler the app's single
//      most important feature simply fails.
//   2. A working OAuth flow. Providers refuse to authenticate inside an
//      embedded browser, so login has to leave the app and come back.
//   3. The security posture a remote-content window requires: no Node in the
//      renderer, no navigating away from our own origin, no in-app windows
//      for third-party links.
