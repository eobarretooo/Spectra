// The picture on a shared link, drawn per page.
//
// One route rather than a file-convention `opengraph-image.tsx` per segment,
// and that is a decision this codebase already paid for once: the root layout
// sets `openGraph.images` explicitly, and a segment that *also* emits one
// through the file convention ends up advertising two pictures on the same
// link with the crawler picking (see the note in app/layout.tsx, where a
// generated route was deleted for exactly that). A plain endpoint that pages
// point at leaves one image per page, named by whoever named it.
//
// Everything is drawn rather than composited from assets: no font is loaded,
// no logo file is fetched. That keeps the route dependency-free — it cannot
// fail because a font CDN is slow while a crawler is waiting — at the cost of
// using whatever the renderer's default face is, which for a card that is 90%
// one line of large text is a trade worth making.
