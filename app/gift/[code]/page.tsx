// landing page that talks about GoLive to somebody who is *being given*
// GoLive. So the code is handed to the home page as a query parameter and the
// dialog opens there (see components/GiftClaimHost).
//
// The parameter survives what has to happen next, which is the reason it is a
// parameter and not a one-shot handoff: whoever follows this link often has no
// account yet, and creating one happens in a dialog on that same page. A code
// kept in memory would not survive the sign-up; one in the URL does.
//
// The move itself is a *client* redirect, and that is not a preference — see
// GiftRedirect. A server redirect leaves nothing for a crawler to read, which
// made every present shared in a chat preview as the home page.
