          the compromise rather than the goal:

            - stacked, below `lg`. The panel goes under the form.
            - side by side from `lg`, centred *as a pair* — so the form sits a
              little left of the page's centre. This is what the whole thing
              used to do at every width.
            - from `xl`, a three-column grid whose outer columns are equal, so
              the form is dead centre of the page and the panel sits to its
              right without moving it.

          The last one cannot start any earlier, and that is arithmetic rather
          than taste: keeping the form centred means reserving the panel's
          width on *both* sides of it, which needs 22 + 28 + 22 rem plus the
          gaps — about 1180px before anything overflows. Below that, a centred
          form would push the panel off the right edge, and a page that scrolls
          sideways is worse than one whose form sits slightly off-centre.

          A guest sees none of this: HomeFriendsPanel renders nothing without an
          account, and the grid's middle column is the form either way. */}

              xl the grid's left column, hugging the form from that side as the

              either way. Below xl there is no room for three abreast, so it
              goes after the form and the friends (order-3) — wrapped onto a
              row of its own at lg, stacked below that.

              Wrapped, and the wrapper always exists: the panel renders nothing
              while the account is still resolving (and for somebody with no
              identity), and a grid missing its first child puts the form in
              the *first* column — the page opening with the form shoved to the
              left. So from xl the wrapper holds the column even when empty
