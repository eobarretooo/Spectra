// The Pro subscription page: what it costs, what it unlocks, and the one
// button that starts or stops it.
//
// The product is called "Pro" on screen and "premium" in storage — the plan
// id, the account field, the feature tiers and the API routes all still say
// premium. That split is deliberate: a name shown to people is a marketing
// decision that can change again, while those others are a document in a
// database, a column other rows point at, and a URL Mercado Pago has on file
// for every existing subscription. Renaming them would be a migration, not a
// rename.
//
// Everything shown here is read from the API. In particular the price is not
// written anywhere in this file — it comes from the plan document in the
// database (see the API's premiumPlan.ts), which is the whole point of that
// document: changing what premium costs is an edit to one row, and every
// surface that quotes a price follows.

// What each entitlement is called in front of a person. Keys come from
// lib/entitlements.ts; a feature with no entry here still counts and is
// simply not listed, which is the right behaviour for a client that predates
// a perk the server already grants.
// Every gated feature needs a line here, and the failure when one is missing
// is silent: the row below drops anything it cannot name, so a perk the plan
// really grants simply never appears on the page selling it. That is what
// happened to the two avatar features — added to the ladder, never given a

 * Whether the checkout has to replace this page instead of opening beside it.

 *
 *   - iOS Safari switches to a new tab the moment it is created, so the blank
 *     placeholder this used to open became the *foreground* tab while the
 *     checkout URL was still being fetched. Assigning a cross-origin URL to
 *     that backgrounded opener-owned tab afterwards is unreliable there, and
 *     iOS discards background tabs under memory pressure — which is exactly
 *     what somebody sees as "the button did nothing and the page reloaded":
 *     the blank tab never navigated, and coming back reloaded this one.
 *   - a standalone PWA has no tab strip at all. `window.open` hands the URL to
 *     the default browser as a separate app, and returning to the installed
 *     window restarts it from its start URL — the same reload, for the same
 *     reason.
 *
 * Navigating in place costs nothing here: the checkout is a full-page flow at
 * Mercado Pago and its back_url points at this very page (see the API's
 * premiumRoutes.ts), so the person lands back on /pro either way — and the
 * status sync on mount is what turns that arrival into an active subscription.
