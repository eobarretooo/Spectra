// invite, a present and the download page all arrived in a chat as the same
// picture with the same sentence. This is the one place that decides
// otherwise.
//
// `images` is set *explicitly* on every page built through here, and that is
// the point rather than a detail: Next merges a segment's openGraph into its
// parent's, so a page that only overrides the title keeps advertising the
// root's picture. Naming it every time is what makes "different per page" true
// of the whole card instead of only its text.
