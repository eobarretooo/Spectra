// The division of labour between the two is the important part, and it is not
// symmetric:
//
//   - the *server* decides what is true. Every account carries a resolved
//     `features` list (see the API's toPublicAccount), computed from the
//     subscription's real state, and that list is the only thing anything
//     gates on.
//   - this file decides what to *say*. It knows which tier each feature
//     belongs to, so a locked option can explain itself — "(conta
//     necessária)" versus "(Premium)" — without the client ever deciding
//     whether the lock applies.
//
// So a feature the server added and this file has never heard of still works:
// it arrives in `features` and is simply allowed. One this file knows about
// and the server does not is never granted. Both directions fail safe, which
// is what lets the two lists drift for a deploy without anything breaking.
