// The web app's half of the Electron bridge.

// Everything here is defensive by design: this file is part of the *website*,
// which is overwhelmingly loaded in an ordinary browser where none of this
// exists. `isDesktopApp()` is the only gate, and every consumer must keep
// working untouched when it returns false — the desktop build is an
// additional shell around the same site, never a fork of it.
//
// The bridge itself is injected by electron/preload.ts through
// contextBridge, so the renderer never sees `require`, `process`, or any
// Node primitive. What crosses the boundary is this interface and nothing
// else.

// Path prefix used as a *marker* in the OAuth `returnTo`, so the callback
// page can tell "this login was started from the desktop app" apart from an
// ordinary browser login. It has to live in the path specifically: the API
// validates `returnTo` against its origin allowlist and keeps only the
// pathname, dropping query and hash (see the API's resolveOrigin) — so the
// path is the one part of that URL that survives the round trip.
//
// The nonce appended to it is what binds a result back to the request that
// asked for it. Any application on the machine can register a custom
// protocol, so an unsolicited `golive://oauth#token=...` could otherwise be
// injected by another program; the desktop side only accepts a fragment
// whose nonce matches a login it is currently waiting on.

 * preload runs before any page script, so reading it is safe from the first
 * line of the bundle, while the Android one is assembled in an effect that
 * awaits two dynamic imports and two native calls (see initCapacitorBridge).
 * Meanwhile signalingClient's constructor registers a stored guest name at
 * module-eval time, and the device it reports is read once, at ws.onopen,
 * with nothing re-registering afterwards. Keyed on the bridge, that returning
 * guest was counted as "mobile-browser" for the life of the connection and
 * missed every announcement aimed at the app. Capacitor's own global is
 * injected by the native layer ahead of the page's scripts — the same thing
 * initCapacitorBridge already trusts synchronously on its first line — so
 * this answer is correct from the first render instead of a few hundred ms
