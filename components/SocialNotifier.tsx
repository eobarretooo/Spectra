// Mounted once at the layout root so it runs on every page: a friend request
// arrives whenever it arrives, and a bell that only filled up while you
// happened to be inside a room would be a bell that is empty exactly when you
// open it.
//
// It is a *sweep*, not a diff. Every pass pushes one notification per pending
// request; the inbox dedups by id (see notificationInbox.ts) and reports
// whether anything was actually new, and only that answer triggers the sound.
// A diff would have to remember what it saw last, across reloads and across
// tabs — which is the same "seen" bookkeeping the inbox already does, done
// twice and able to disagree with itself.
