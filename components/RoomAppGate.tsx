// Where a room decides whether it is a room at all yet.
//
// Two jobs, and they are two halves of one idea: the site cannot know whether
// the desktop app is installed — browsers removed every API that leaked it,
// because it is a fingerprinting vector — so it *learns*, once, from somebody
// actually using it.
//
//   Before it knows. Nothing is asked up front; the room opens exactly as it
//   always did, and OpenInAppBanner offers the handoff from inside it. Nobody
//   is made to answer a question about software they may not have.
//
//   The handoff. The room is left (unmounting WatchRoom is what calls
//   leaveRoom) and this screen takes its place, so the person is not sitting
//   in the room twice. If the tab actually loses visibility, the app opened —
//   that is the confirmation, and it is the only honest one available.
//
//   After it knows. The offer moves in front of the door: a confirmed
//   installation gets asked *before* joining, which is the whole point —
//   choosing the app after joining means arriving twice.
//
// Every screen here keeps a way into the browser, because nothing on this page
// can tell whether the OS found anything. A dead end would be the one failure
// with no recovery.
