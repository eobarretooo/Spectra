// GoLive Android shell — the Capacitor equivalent of electron/main.ts.
//
// Same shape, same reasoning: this is a shell around the *deployed site*, not
// a second copy of it. The WebView loads https://golive.nemtudo.me (or
// whatever GOLIVE_APP_URL says — the exact env var electron/main.ts reads,
// reused here on purpose so both shells are pointed the same way with one
// override) and the entire UI, all the WebRTC, comes from there unchanged.
//
// Bundling the Next build into the APK instead would buy nothing: this is a
// real-time app that is useless offline anyway, and the site has server-side
// API routes (/api/giphy, /api/umami) a static export cannot serve. One
// deploy, one thing to keep working — see electron/main.ts's own comment,
// which this mirrors.
//
// `webDir` is required by the Capacitor CLI even though nothing in it is ever
// loaded (server.url below always wins over bundled assets). It points at
// public/ rather than an empty folder so `npx cap sync` has something real to
// copy — Android's cold-start splash background and any offline fallback
// asset both come from there.
